## what is PPP?
PPP is a kind of spatial price index, which can eliminate the price differences among economies by measuring the purchasing power of their currencies, so that the international comparison of GDP can be based on the actual volume of goods. Theoretically, its comparison results are more objective and scientific than the exchange rate method.
