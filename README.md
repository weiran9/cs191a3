# ps4 Index
## what is PPP?
PPP is a kind of spatial price index, which can eliminate the price differences among economies by measuring the purchasing power of their currencies, so that the international comparison of GDP can be based on the actual volume of goods. Theoretically, its comparison results are more objective and scientific than the exchange rate method.
## why ps4?
The ps4 is a home game console released by Sony in North America from November 15, 2013. Despite its age, it is still being produced and sold in 2022, and on December 31, 2019, cumulative worldwide sales of the PS4 have surpassed 106 million units. It is widely known and sold in almost every country in the world, which is why I chose it for this project
## the creation of index
### 1. Scrape PS4 pricing data from website
I found ps4 price data for over 100 countries on https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/Prices which was enough for me to complete the project. I used the method from the class to import the data from the website into the table.
### 2. clean up data
I removed the information for Chile and Kuwait from the table, as they did not import correctly, and corrected the information for Canada. Then used the split function to extract the numbers and currency symbols from the table separately 
### 3. change all currency to USD
I scrape over their country code from currencyscoop.com and add the country code to my own form for the next currency conversion. Then I use a for loop to iterate through all the countries on my table to convert each country's currency to USD using the currencyscoop.com API.
### 4.calculate difference between American price and price from other countries
I took the converted prices and subtracted the US PS4 prices to calculate the difference between them, simply subtracting 399.00 from each price.
### 5. plot the difference

I have plotted the difference as a horizontal bar graph using the barh function. You can see that the spreads for most countries are within a very small range, and there are even some countries whose currencies are pegged to the dollar that have no spread at all. But there are a few countries that have very large and negative spreads like Argentina and the Czech Republic.
### 6. import supplementry data
To research why the ps4 has such a big price change in these countries, I went to unstats.un.org, Unitednation Department of Economic and Social Affairs
Statistics and downloaded the GDP per capita for each country in 2020. In this data, I dropped the year and units on the table because we don't need those. For the average expenditure per household, I downloaded the data from another website and did the same manipulate to it.
I chose 2020 data instead of 2022 because of the lack of statistics for most third world countries, the most recent and complete data is in 2020.
### 7. plot graphs
